### Features - Django REST Framework
1. Make your site a DRF powered API as you did in previous lab.
2. Adjust projectâ€™s permissions so that only authenticated users have access to API.
3. Add a custom permission so that only author of blog post can update or delete it.
4. Add ability to switch users directly from browsable API.

### Features - Docker
NOTE Refer to demo for built out Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml examples.

1. create Dockerfile based off python:3.8-slim
2. create docker-compose.yml to run Django app as a web service.
3. enter docker-compose up --build to start your site.
add postgres 11 as a service
Note: It is not required to include a volume so that data can persist when container is shut down.
4. Go to browsable api and confirm site properly restricts users based on their permissions.
